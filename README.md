Reversible-Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler for inference in ARX models with Student-t innovations

This code was downloaded from < https://github.com/compops/rj-mcmc-std > or from < http://www.rt.isy.liu.se/~johda87/code.html > and contains the code used to produce the results in the poster for

*J. Dahlin, F. Lindsten and T. B. Sch√∂n,
Particle Metropolis Hastings using Langevin Dynamics. 
Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 
Vancouver, Canada, May 2013.

The paper is available as a preprint from < http://www.rt.isy.liu.se/~johda87/publications.html > and the poster with the example (generated by this code) is found at < http://users.isy.liu.se/en/rt/johda87/presentations.html >.

Requirements
--------------
The program is written in C with the use of the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) for generation of random number. As such, it must be compiled on your platform to be able to run. This therefore requires you to have GSL installed on your system. On Ubuntu this is taken care of by executing the command "sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev"

The software R (http://cran.r-project.org/) is used for plotting the results and is freely available for download.

Complilation
--------------
Compile the code by using the makefile included. In Ubuntu this amounts to executing "make" in the console.

Execute the code by writing ./RUNME

The plots are generated by the code in RUNME_PLOTTING.R which can be opened and executed in R (don't forget to change your working directory to the folder with the RUNME output before executing the code)

Included files
--------------

**RUNME**
Executes the C program which estimates the likelihood and score for the Hull-White Stochastic volatility model. The output is saved in outputData with log-likelihood in the odd columns and score in the even for phi=-0.90:0.10:0.90. Each row is 100 enteries long as the experiment is repeated 50 times on the same data set.

The second part of the program estimates phi in the Hull-White model given a set of 100 data points. The output is saved in outputMH (for PMMH) which contains the parameter estimates in the first column and the resulting log-likelihood in the second. For L-PMH, the results are saved in outputLMC and it contains: the parameter value, the scaled score and the log-likelihood as the columns of each row.

**RUNME_PLOTTING.R**
R-code for reproducing the results in the ICASSP poster. It makes use of the output from RUNME to create the plot.
